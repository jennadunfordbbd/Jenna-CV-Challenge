          <h3>A Little Bit About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I was born in raised in beautiful, sunny, humid KZN, Durban. From a
            young age I loved being creative in everything I did, I had a keen
            interest in artwork, writing, music and video games.
          </p>
          <p>
            Attending Westville Girls High School, I discovered my love for
            programming and software development, and it became something that I
            was eager to pursue.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that my love for creativity, literature and art is firmly
            intertwined with my interest in programming. I can express myself
            artistically through both - especially in situations of problem
            solving when creative thinking is key.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of my more recent interests in animation - where every frame
            needs to be perfectly constructed in order to show a complete
            movement or scene. There is so much complexity and thought given to
            things like physics and the mathematics of perspective and angles
            when considering an animation.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think back to the era of the Renaissance, where the most
            celebrated engineers and mathematicians were also brilliant painters
            and sculptures. As a society today we prefer to separate STEM fields
            from more artistic ones. I think that this is a sad mistake, and
            that both are more alike than people realize. Their similarities
            should be embraced in everything we do.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am looking forward to a career in software development, where I
            can also practice and continue to learn about the creative subjects
            I love, in the hopes that it will make me a better programmer and
            engineer.
