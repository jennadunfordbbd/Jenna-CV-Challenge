      <h3>A Little Bit About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I was born in raised in beautiful, sunny, humid KZN, Durban. From a
        young age I loved being creative in everything I did, I had a keen
        interest in artwork, writing, music and video games.
      </p>
      <p>
        Attending Westville Girls High School, I discovered my love for
        programming and software development, and it became something that I was
        eager to pursue.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that my love for creativity, literature and art is firmly
        intertwined with my interest in programming. I can express myself
        artistically through both - especially in situations of problem solving
        when creative thinking is key.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my more recent interests in animation - where every frame needs
        to be perfectly constructed in order to show a complete movement or
        scene. There is so much complexity and thought given to things like
        physics and the mathematics of perspective and angles when considering
        an animation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think back to the era of the Renaissance, where the most celebrated
        engineers and mathematicians were also brilliant painters and
        sculptures. As a society today we prefer to separate STEM fields from
        more artistic ones. I think that this is a sad mistake, and that both
        are more alike than people realize. Their similarities should be
        embraced in everything we do.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am looking forward to a career in software development, where I can
        also practice and continue to learn about the creative subjects I love,
        in the hopes that it will make me a better programmer and engineer.
